## Summary
Being that I had previously went to college for accounting, I would like to make a simple book keeping app. This app will consist of a list of debtors and will track their payments.
The book keeper will be able to add new debtors, reduce/increase debt and remove debtors.

## Interface

If I could get interaction with using a table, that would be great otherwise, I'll use an unorganized list. This list will hold the debtors information and how much they owe.
There will be a couple buttons(not sure how many). One button will be able to increase or decrease debts the other button will be able to add new debtors. 

## Layout

The layout will be CSS grid. The first row will be where the user interacts with all the data. The rest will be a container of all the information. 

## Animations

Animations could be more of stretch goal. For example, if a debtors pays his dues, we could do some text decoration to make it disappear.
